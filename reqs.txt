for the summary:

- How is the variance calculated? Is it standardized? It needs to be, if not.
- The format needs to be different. There needs to be a single index (the subject), 
each behaviour needs to have a set of columns (one for count, one for sum, etc)
- interbout duraction and variance (standardized) need to be across all behaviours and not per behaviour
(behaviours that don't apply to a subject don't need to be considered)
- add each location as a proportion of the count for each behaviour
