for each csv file
    read each line
    group lines by subject
    for each subject
        construct timeline with behaviors
        sort behaviors by start time
        initialize bout counter to 0
        initialize end time of previous behavior to -1
        for each behavior in behaviors
            if start time of behavior >= end time of previous behavior + 10 seconds
                increment bout counter
            add bout counter to behavior
            update end time of previous behavior
        extract behaviors, areas, bout length, behavior duration, bout
        run statistics on these behaviors 
        save information to dictionary-type structure
